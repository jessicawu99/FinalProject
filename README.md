# City Bike Explorer
The motivation behind my project is to encourage city exploration through docking bicycle-sharing systems and generating awareness around public bike systems in general. These bike-sharing systems allow users to rent a bike from a dock/station which can then be returned at another dock throughout the city. My application prompts the user to enter their current location and a desired bike route length. If there is indeed a nearby bike-share system, it will suggest an end station as well as a point of interest near the end point.

## Usage Tips
<ul>
<li>To test different cities, here is a map of cities with bike-share systems: http://api.citybik.es/v2/
<li>I most often used cities such as Philadelphia, New York, and Paris to test my application.
<li>When entering your address, make sure to include the city and state or country.
